# Cloud Security

> A curated list of Cloud Security documentation and Open Source Projects related to it.

Cloud security is a broad set of policies, technologies, applicationsope , and controls utilized to protect virtualized IP, data, applications, services, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing.

Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer. The cloud provider is responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for the security of their data and applications.

There are a number of cloud security best practices that organizations can follow to protect their data and applications in the cloud. These include:

Choose a reputable cloud provider. When choosing a cloud provider, it is important to do your research and select a provider that has a strong track record of security.
Implement strong access controls. It is important to implement strong access controls to your cloud resources. This includes using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC).
Encrypt your data. It is important to encrypt your data at rest and in transit. This will help to protect your data from unauthorized access.
Monitor your cloud environment. It is important to monitor your cloud environment for security threats. This includes using cloud security tools to detect and respond to threats.
Stay up-to-date on the latest security threats. It is important to stay up-to-date on the latest security threats. This will help you to protect your cloud environment from emerging threats.

# Why Cloud Security

Cloud security is important because it helps to protect your data and applications from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

Here are some of the reasons why cloud security is important:

- Data breaches are a real threat. In 2021, there were over 15 billion records exposed in data breaches. This data could include personal information, financial information, and intellectual property.
- Cloud computing is a popular target for hackers. Because cloud computing is so widely used, it is a popular target for hackers. Hackers can target cloud computing environments to steal data, launch denial-of-service attacks, or disrupt services.
- Cloud computing is complex. The complexity of cloud computing makes it difficult to secure. There are many different components to cloud computing environments, and each component has its own security risks.

# Identity and access management (IAM)


Identity and access management (IAM) is a framework of policies and technologies that helps organizations secure their systems and data by controlling who has access to what. IAM encompasses the processes of creating, managing, and retiring user identities, as well as controlling access to resources such as applications, data, and systems.

# Detection

Security detection in the cloud refers to the process of identifying and responding to security threats and incidents within a cloud environment. Cloud providers offer various security detection mechanisms and services to help customers protect their data and applications. 
Some common security detection capabilities in the cloud:
1. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
2. Log Management and Analysis
3. Threat Intelligence
4. Security Analytics
5. Vulnerability Scanning
6. Behavioral Analysis
6. File Integrity Monitoring
7. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection
8. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

# Cloud Infrastructure Protection

Cloud infrastructure protection is the practice of securing cloud-based resources, such as servers, storage, and networks. It is a critical aspect of cloud security and is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud-based data and applications.

# Data Protection


Data protection is the process of ensuring that data is secure from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It is a critical aspect of information security and is essential for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

# Zero Trust in Cloud Security

Zero trust is a security model that assumes that no user or device is inherently trustworthy, even if they are inside the network perimeter. This means that all access to resources, regardless of location, must be authenticated and authorized.

Zero trust is a departure from traditional security models, which rely on perimeter security to protect assets. Perimeter security is based on the idea that the network perimeter is a secure boundary that can be used to keep unauthorized users out. However, this model is no longer effective in today's world, where users and devices can connect to the network from anywhere.
